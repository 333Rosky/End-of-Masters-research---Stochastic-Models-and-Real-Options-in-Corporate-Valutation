## Project Overview

This research investigates the integration of **stochastic and deterministic aspects** in financial simulations for company valuation using real options theory. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to construct underlying processes for calculating net present value (NPV), considering both predictable and unpredictable factors. The study emphasizes the use of real options theory to evaluate investment possibilities and divestment choices, underlining the importance of flexibility and adaptability in corporate finance.

### Primary Research Question
**"How do stochastic and deterministic methods, along with the integration of real options, influence the net present value (NPV) of a company, and what are the implications of these methods for corporate investment decisions?"**

### Key Findings
- Interest rates have a greater negative influence on NPV during recessions, increasing abandonment likelihood
- Volatility negatively impacts NPV, showing that greater uncertainty results in lower valuations
- Organizations with higher market risk exhibit greater responsiveness to market conditions
- Options with longer maturities generally hold higher values
- Stochastic NPV is lower than deterministic NPV on average, highlighting uncertainty's importance

## Research Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. **Combine stochastic models, deterministic approaches, and real options theory** to create a comprehensive investment evaluation framework
2. **Implement Monte Carlo simulations** to model cash flow uncertainty and provide probabilistic insights
3. **Apply Black-Scholes model** to evaluate real options for expansion and abandonment decisions
4. **Analyze performance across three economic scenarios**: boom, normal, and recession conditions

### Research Hypotheses Tested
- H1: Interest rate reductions have non-linear effects on NPV with diminishing returns
- H2: High NPV volatility correlates positively with expansion option values
- H3: Higher operating cash flows consistently show higher NPVs (weakens during downturns)
- H4: Higher interest rates increase abandonment option exercise likelihood
- H5: Companies with higher market returns have higher betas (more pronounced during recessions)
- H6: Options with longer maturities consistently have higher values
- H7: Companies with stationary cash flows enable more reliable NPV predictions

## Methodology

### Theoretical Framework
- **Real Options Theory**: Valuing flexibility and strategic decisions
- **Stochastic Processes**: Modeling uncertain cash flows and interest rates
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Generating multiple scenarios for risk assessment
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Traditional and risk-adjusted approaches

### Data Analysis Approach
1. **Data Collection**: Historical financial data from WRDS (Compustat/CRSP)
2. **Interest Rate Analysis**: US Treasury rates as risk-free benchmarks
3. **Statistical Modeling**: Stochastic cash flow simulation
4. **Comparative Analysis**: Traditional vs. stochastic valuation methods
